				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Through calculation, I found that in the regions where the 2018 Hong Kong Legislative Council election results of all voting stations have released, pan-democrat party is more widely supported, as the winners from this party accounting for 59.3%.</p>

				   <p>Each of the three regions has more than three candidates, but from the map, we can see that interestingly in three regions, there is always a pan-democrat member competing with a pro-establishment member.</p>

				<p>And the three pie charts clearly show that in Hong Kong Island and New Territories East, people advocate pan-democrat more than pro-establishment. But in Kowloon West, pro-establishment win the publicâ€™s support.</p>
